            <p>Mount Timpanogos, often referred to as Timp, is the second-highest mountain in Utah's Wasatch Range.
                Timpanogos rises to an elevation of 11,752 ft (3,582 m) above sea level in the Uinta-Wasatch-Cache
                National Forest. With 5,270 ft (1,610 m) of topographic prominence, Timpanogos is the 47th-most
                prominent mountain in the contiguous United States.</p>

            <p>The temple was announced by Gordon B. Hinckley, then a counselor in the church's First Presidency, in
                general conference on October 3, 1992. The exact location, on land in American Fork previously used as a
                church welfare farm, was announced at the following conference six months later. The Mount Timpanogos
                Utah Temple overlooks the cities of American Fork, Cedar Hills, Highland and Alpine as well as nearby
                Utah Lake. Mount Timpanogos, a majestic 11,750-foot peak, and the Wasatch Mountains serve as a backdrop.

                and easily accessible by more than one million people along the Wasatch Front, Utah.
                It protects a cave system on Mount Timpanogos in Northern Utah's Wasatch
                Mountains in American Fork Canyon. There are three caves in the National Monument: Hansen Cave, Middle
                Cave, and Timpanogos Cave.</p>
